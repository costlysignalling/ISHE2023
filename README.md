# ISHE2023

Materials for the **ISHE Summer Institute 2023** workshop

Download the **script.R** if you hate typing and just want to ctrl+enter along. We may not have time to cover everything, so feel free to browse this file to see what a 5-hour version of this workshop might entail. You may want to start by running the R-studio from the **.Rproj** file of the same name saved in the same file as the script.

The **handout** word and pdf files (otherwise identical) contain the cheat sheet that you obtain in paper at the start of the workshop.

The **schedule** is here so I do not loose the file. We may significantly deviate from it, though.

The **cards** can be used in similar workhops to assign data-generating tasks to participants. The (HARD) options usually require additional insights or googling. (EASY) and (MEDIUM) tasks can be completed using the script and handout alone.
